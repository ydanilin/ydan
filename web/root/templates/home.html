            I always try to record what was done, learned, investigated,
            whenever I'm doing either a commercial or pet programming project, or some DIY stuff.<br>
            This creates a <b>knowledge base</b> we can consult with when needed.
            When possible, I prefer using pictures like <a class="teal-text text-darken-2"href="{{ url_for('scratches.show_nginx_setups')}}">
                shown here.

                    Not the most creative part of our life but really needed.
                    Memory cards how to do (how I did) various system setup tasks.

                    What workflow I use to write articles in a way to be easily ported from
                    simple (Markdown) text either onto website or PDF paper.
                    This includes issues with graphics, formulas, styles etc.
                    Start point is Markdown in VSCode, which then
                    goes into Pandoc to be converted appropriately...
